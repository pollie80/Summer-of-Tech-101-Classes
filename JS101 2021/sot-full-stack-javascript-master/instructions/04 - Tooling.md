# Tooling

Thankfully, as developers we don't need to know everything to write a web application as tooling exists to abstract away complexity so we can dive straight into to writing our application.

A good example is [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). It sets us up with boilerplate code, build scripts to optimise perfomance and a nice development environment.

Then we can combine this with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as our tool to handle the deployment of our site. It deploys our app to a webserver without needing to write one 🤯

Once you're done with that, you can move on to [**Project Setup**](./05%20-%20Project%20Setup.md). 👏👏👏
