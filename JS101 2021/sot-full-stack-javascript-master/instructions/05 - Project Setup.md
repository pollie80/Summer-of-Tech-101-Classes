# Project setup

Before we kick into writing code, let's explore our **Web Application Architecture**

* Node backend with a **serverless** web server
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end

We'll use `create-react-app` to generate the boilerplate of our project. This will give us everything we need to get cracking straight away.

```
npx create-react-app my-portfolio
```

Change directory into the folder that was just created:

```
cd my-portfolio
```

Looking in this folder, we have a functioning website!

The `package.json` file is located in the `root` of our folder and the files we edit are located in `src`.

Spin it up with:
```
npm start
```

Wait for it to build, then head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see your website!

Once you're done with that, you can move on to [**Deploying**](./06%20-%20Deploying.md). 👏👏👏
