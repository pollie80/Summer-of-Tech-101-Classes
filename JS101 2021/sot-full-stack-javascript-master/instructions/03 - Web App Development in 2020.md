# What does Web Application development in 2020 look like?
There is a lot to consider when building a web app, not to mention learn, and it can seem daunting knowing where to start.

* What framework should I use? React? Angular? Vue?
* How will I serve data? REST? GraphQL? Databases?
* Where will I host the app?
* How do I deploy the app?

A good reference is [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/).

It gives good pathways for both [frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and [backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend), as well as the best resources to learn them.

As you can see, there is a lot that goes into modern web applications, but today we'll learn the basics from both to get you up and running so you can venture down the paths with a bit more context.
