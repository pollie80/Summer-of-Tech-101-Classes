# Introduction

Welcome 🖐️🖐️🖐️

In this JavaScript Masterclass we'll be looking at the full development lifecycle of a web app - Back end and front end, from creation to production deployment.

The goal of the session will be to give you a simple boilerplate portfolio website.

Topics we'll cover:

* Write a small **serverless** Node API
* Write a simple front end with React
* Deploy our website to the web using Vercel

## Next

Once you're done with that, you can move on to [**Prerequisites and Install**](./02%20-%20Prequisites%20and%20Install.md). 👏👏👏
