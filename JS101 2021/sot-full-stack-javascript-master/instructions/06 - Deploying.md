# Deploying

Vercel makes it incredibly easy to deploy our `create-react-app` project. It identifies that it's a React project, then does all the build and deploy steps for us.

Make sure you're logged in:
```
vercel login
```
Note: Accept all prompts if asked!

Then deploy! (make sure you're in the project `root`)
```
vercel
```

Easy! This takes a moment, but will give you a link to the Vercel site to check the progress and visit the site.

## Next

Once you're done with that, you can move on to [**Serverless Applications**](./07%20-%20Serverless%20Applications.md). 👏👏👏
